Project: Space Shooter
Peer's repository: Annuvian?



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 -That Unity is waaaaaay better for building games than VS Code and Python Arcade

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 -The use of menus and sound files, as well as the overall use of Unity

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 -I suggest you teach me how to do some of this, yo.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 -You could have left a note for the need to extract the zipped file to play using Unity. Anyone else in this class might not
 have known how to do that, and it took me awhile to figure how to run it in my Unity application.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 -Honestly it all confused me, but that's a me problem, the code was great.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 -Indeed it does.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 -Just instructions on opening the game application.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

-Holy hell this was cool, it blew my expectations out of the water. I love the unique concept plus the use of Unity, it 
circumvented the restrictions placed on us with this crappy excuse of a game engine (Python Arcade just hurts)
